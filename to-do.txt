Messaging apps (a.k.a. social messaging or chat applications) are apps and platforms that enable instant messaging. 
Many such apps have developed into broad platforms enabling status updates, chatbots, payments and conversational commerce (e-commerce via chat).
My aim is to build a chat application using the Next js web framework.
Next.js is an open-source React front-end development web framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering 
and generating static websites for React based web applications.
The frontend would be pretty basic with  a sidebar to view all the chats and a messaging window.
You can navigate through your chats and the page will be immediately available because it's being rendered
on the server and then it gets delivered to the client .
The messaging window will also have a auto scroll function as well as the last active status.
The signup with google functionality will be available.
The application will be deployed using Vercel.




you can go ahead on the sidebar
and you can pretty much navigate through
your chats and here you can see when we
load a chat immediately the chat is
available because it's being rendered
on the server and then it gets delivered
to the client right so i'll explain all
